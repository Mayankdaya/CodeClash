# **App Name**: CodeClash

## Core Features:

- Topic Selection and Matchmaking: Users select a coding topic (e.g., 'Arrays,' 'Strings') and are instantly matched with 1-3 peers via a unique URL or code, with no signup required for basic use.
- Real-Time Collaboration: Participants chat, share ideas, and submit solutions in a built-in code editor, synced in real-time, with a timer for the 30-minute session.
- Gamified Experience: Award points for solving first, solution accuracy, or helpful chat contributions; include simple leaderboards and badges (e.g., 'Algorithm Ace') to enhance excitement.
- Auto-Expiry: Sessions archive automatically after 30 minutes to keep the app fresh and focused on temporary battles.
- Simple Dashboard: Display active sessions, opponents, scores, and chat, with engaging visuals and quick actions (e.g., join, submit code).
- Problem Bank: Include a curated set of 50 LeetCode-style problems across topics (e.g., arrays, dynamic programming), with simple validation (e.g., regex-based output checking).

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Subtle Blue (#94B49F) to enhance a glassmorphism visual, evoke a sense of professionalism, intellect, and modernism.
- Background color: Light Gray (#F0F4EF) with a very light desaturation, suited to a light scheme
- Accent color: Sea Green (#A8D5BA), chosen as an analogous color that will pop against the light gray background.
- Font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, for a modern and neutral feel, used for both headlines and body text. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Employ glassmorphism effects: frosted glass look, subtle transparency, light borders, to deliver a very professional and classy user interface.
- Use simple, outline-style icons to match the professional aesthetic and improve clarity.
