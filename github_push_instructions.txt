# Instructions for Pushing CodeClash to GitHub

Follow these steps to push your CodeClash project to GitHub:

## Prerequisites
- Git installed on your computer
- A GitHub account
- A GitHub repository created at https://github.com/Mayankdaya/CodeClash

## Step 1: Set up Git if not already set up
```
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

## Step 2: Initialize Git repository (if not already initialized)
```
git init
```

## Step 3: Add the GitHub repository as remote
```
git remote add origin https://github.com/Mayankdaya/CodeClash.git
```
If you get an error that the remote already exists, you can remove it first:
```
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/Mayankdaya/CodeClash.git
```

## Step 4: Stage all files (excluding .trae folder due to .gitignore)
```
git add .
```

## Step 5: Commit your changes
```
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

## Step 6: Push to GitHub
```
git push -u origin main
```

If you get an error about the branch name, try:
```
git push -u origin master
```

Or create a main branch and push:
```
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 7: Authenticate with GitHub
When prompted, enter your GitHub username and password or personal access token.

Note: If you're using HTTPS and password authentication is disabled, you'll need to create a personal access token at https://github.com/settings/tokens and use that as your password.
